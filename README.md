## Building an In-Person Network 

We covered the importance of leveraging your professional network as well as how to find like-minded people online. Building an online community is a helpful way to connect to opportunities and get a job.

Where possible, you should also build your in-person network.


## Why In-Person Networking Matters

Despite this digital age, nothing is stronger than connecting face-to-face. Here are a few reasons why in-person networking is still important.

1. **Accelerates relationship building** - When you meet someone face-to-face, you’re able to learn more about that person in ten minutes than it would take over several months online.

2. **Recognition** - If meeting in-person, people can put a face to your name as well as pick up on the actions you embody. This allows them to form a personal impression of you, which is much more memorable than any email you can send.

3. **Increased understanding** - When face-to-face, you can hear the tone of voice, see facial expressions, and observe body language. Because of this, there’s increased understanding and it’s easier to convey purpose. 

4. **Opportunity to meet a variety of people** - There’s this serendipitous nature at live events. You never know who you may meet. And often the best connections come from the people you least expect. 

## Types of In-Person Networking

When it comes to face-to-face networking, there are lots of options. Here are some of the most common. 

1. **[Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/)** - Meetup is a platform where anyone can organize an in-person get together around a certain topic. There are lots of tech meetups in cities across the world. Meetups give you the chance to connect with others, learn about new products, and listen to talks. Meetups are usually free to attend. However, some may cost money, but usually not more than $5-10. 

2. **Associations/organizations** - These tend to be more formal gatherings, usually closed to members only. Being a part of an association/organization often means you must apply, and pay a membership fee. Example: [Women in Technology International](http://www.witi.com/)

3. **Conferences**- Conferences are typically several days in length, and held at convention halls or large hotels. Because of this, they are often at a higher price point. Many people will travel to attend conferences. Example: [RailsConf](http://railsconf.com/)
 
4. **Coworking spaces** - Coworking spaces are places people without an office go to work. Many of these people work for larger companies remotely, freelance, work at startups, or even have their own business. Coworking itself is a great way to meet people. However, many coworking spaces also host their own events. Example: [WeWork](https://www.wework.com/)

5. **Volunteering** - Volunteering is an underrated networking method. Unlike happy hours and networking events, volunteering centers on giving back to a cause. However, it also provides the chance to meet new people who share your interests and do impactful work. Meeting people at volunteer events shows the people present that you’re passionate about programming and you work hard. Example: [Girls Who Code](http://girlswhocode.com/get-involved/)

While building a developer community is important, don’t limit yourself to attending only tech events. If you attend events outside of tech the industry, you’ll stand out more. *Because you’ll probably be one of the few there with technical skills!*
All companies and industries need tech talent. 

Still, make sure to attend events you have an interest in. This way you’ll be able to make genuine connections with people who are also attending, and learn something in the process. 

## Three Key Things to Keep in Mind When Meeting New People

There are entire books dedicated to the art of networking. They include rules to follow, body language signals to be aware of, ways to break the ice, and a whole lot more. Yet, when it comes down to it, there are two main things you need to keep in mind when you’re meeting new people face-to-face. 

**1. Always Provide Value**

Value is something that keeps appearing throughout these lessons. That’s because it’s so important—whether you’re reaching out online for the first time, asking for an introduction, or meeting in-person. People network because they want to meet new people, and ultimately get something from that person. (A referral, a new job, a book deal—whatever.) 

When you’re at an event, it doesn’t matter how many hands you shake, or business cards you give out. What is important is providing value by helping others. Giving first is the start of many great relationships. When you’re the first person to provide value, it gives you leverage. Leverage that you can use later. 

When you’re networking and providing value for others, remember that the more important/influential the person is, the more giving you must do upfront. 

You need to give value over time, until eventually you’re at a point where you can ask for something in return and it won’t come off as a nuisance. Rather, you just provided this person with so much value that they don’t even think twice about returning the favor.

**2. Listen**

The best way to figure out that value you can provide to another person is by listening to them. In order to make an authentic connection to a person you must pay attention to what that person is saying, and not thinking about what you’re going to say next. 

**3. Be patient**

Part of building a strong in-person network involves patience. Don’t rush into asking new connections for favors. Instead, build up your relationship over time. 

Recognize that not everyone you meet is going to be able to give you what you want right away. Some of the connections you establish may not seem to be helpful, but they might offer you value when you least expect it a year or two from now, and that’s okay.

Think of it like building long-term friendships. *You don’t ask someone you just befriended to drive you to the airport, or help you move, do you?* Exactly. You ask your closest, and longtime, friends.

## Conclusion 

The best way to build a community is by getting out and going to events in your area.  While this may be easier in large cities, if you work a little harder (or drive a little further), you’ll very likely find tech events regardless of where you live. 

When you’re at events, don’t think about what you can get out of the experience. Instead, think about what you can give to others. This kind of mindset will make you more likable, and set a strong foundation for your relationships down the line.
